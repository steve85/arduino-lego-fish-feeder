# Arduino Lego Fish Feeder

Simple arduino sketch for a DIY fish feeder.

This simple project uses a servo which is housed in a Lego frame to rotate a container on a scheduled basis to automatically feed our pet fish.

## Components

The project uses the following:
- Arduino Uno
- Arduino Protoshield board
- SM-S4303R continous rotation servo
- Lego housing to hold servo and rotating container (in our case a Playdough container with a 5mm hole drilled in the side)

## Pinout/Schematic

- **PIN 8** - LED status light (wired via the appropriate resistor).
- **PIN 9** - Control wire to servo (powered via appropriate power supply/common ground with arduino via breadboard).
