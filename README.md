# Arduino Lego Fish Feeder

Simple arduino sketch for a DIY fish feeder.

This simple project uses a servo which is housed in a Lego frame to rotate a container on a scheduled basis to automatically feed our pet fish.

## Components

The project uses the following:
- Arduino Uno
- Arduino Protoshield board
- SM-S4303R continous rotation servo

## Pinout/Schematic

- **PIN 0** - Control wire to servo (powered via external 6v power supply/common ground with arduino via breadboard).
- **PIN 8** - LED status light (wired via the appropriate resistor).
